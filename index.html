<h1> Notes for Project 2 </h1>
<p> Our proejct uses the api for the Star Wars, but mainly the films and the planets. For the films, we do the onclick on the image
for the the name and introduction. For the planets, we create a rect that you can clicked on to view the table. Other than that, we also 
  have a sort function in the table. If you click on the Rotation_Period, the table is going to sort by it<br>
The overall design is like ok. The color is really comfortable to look at, and the there are some hover effect on the images as well as on
the onclick for planets.
