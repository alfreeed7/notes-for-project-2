<h1> Notes for Project 2 </h1>
<p> Our proejct uses the api for the Star Wars, but mainly the films and the planets. For the films, we do the onclick on the image
for the the name, introduction and the information of planets. We bind the planets' data with the films perfectly. For the planets,
  we also have a sort function in the table.If you click on the Rotation_Period, the table is going to sort by it<br>
The overall design is like ok. The color is really comfortable to look at, and the there are some hover effect on the images as well as on
the onclick for planets.
